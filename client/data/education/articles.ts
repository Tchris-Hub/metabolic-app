    summary: 'A comprehensive guide to understanding Type 2 diabetes, from basic science to practical daily management strategies that work.',
    content: [
      'Type 2 diabetes is a chronic metabolic condition that affects how your body processes blood sugar (glucose). Unlike Type 1 diabetes, where the body produces no insulin, Type 2 diabetes occurs when your body either resists the effects of insulin or doesn\'t produce enough insulin to maintain normal glucose levels.',
      '',
      'WHAT IS INSULIN AND WHY DOES IT MATTER?',
      'Insulin is a hormone produced by your pancreas that acts like a key, unlocking cells to allow glucose (sugar) from your bloodstream to enter and provide energy. When you have Type 2 diabetes, this system doesn\'t work properly. Your cells become resistant to insulin\'s effects, forcing your pancreas to produce more and more insulin. Eventually, your pancreas can\'t keep up with the demand, leading to elevated blood sugar levels.',
      '',
      'RECOGNIZING THE SYMPTOMS',
      'Many people with Type 2 diabetes don\'t experience obvious symptoms initially, which is why it\'s often called a "silent" disease. However, as blood sugar levels rise, you may notice:',
      '• Increased thirst and frequent urination (especially at night)',

      '• Dark patches of skin (acanthosis nigricans), often in armpits or neck',
      '',
      'If you experience any combination of these symptoms, consult your healthcare provider for testing. Early detection makes management significantly easier and prevents complications.',
      '',
      'WHO IS AT RISK?',
      'While anyone can develop Type 2 diabetes, certain factors increase your risk:',
      '• Being overweight or obese (BMI over 25)',
      '• Physical inactivity or sedentary lifestyle',
      '• Family history of diabetes (parent or sibling)',
      '• Age 45 or older (though increasingly common in younger people)',
      '• Prediabetes (blood sugar higher than normal but not yet diabetic)',
      '• History of gestational diabetes during pregnancy',
