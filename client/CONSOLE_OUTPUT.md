# 🎯 **Perfect! The Debug Logs Are Working**

## 📋 **What I Need From Your Console Output**

From your screenshots, I can see the debug logs are running, but I need the **actual text output** to diagnose the issue.

### **📸 Please Share The Console Text**

**Copy and paste the console output that shows:**
```
🚀 Starting profile save...
User ID: [your-user-id]
🔍 Debug Info:
User object: { ... }
User ID: [your-user-id]
User ID type: string
Payload: { ... }
❌ Supabase error: [exact error message]
```

### **🎯 Key Things I Need To See**

1. **The actual User ID value**
2. **The complete Payload object**
3. **The exact error message** (if any)
4. **What happens after the payload** (success or failure)

---

## 🔍 **What The Logs Will Tell Us**

### **✅ If Working:**
- Payload saves successfully
- User navigates to goals screen
- No error messages

### **❌ If Broken:**
- **Database error** → Tells us the specific issue
- **User ID problems** → Shows if authentication is working
- **Payload issues** → Shows data format problems

---

## 🚀 **Next Step**

**Please copy the console output text and share it here.** 

**The debug logs will show us exactly what's failing!** 🎯

**What do you see in the console after the profile save runs?**
